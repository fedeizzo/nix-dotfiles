** Fresh install
*** Dell xps 9510
Partitioning is made with ~btrfs~ file system, during it two blank read-only snapshots are taken:
- ~root~
- ~home~

It can be done with the following script:
#+begin_src sh
./partitioning_btrfs.sh
#+end_src

Snapshots are used to erase the disk at every boot in order to obtain a complete immutable and declarative system.

Obviously some data, logs, cache, etc. must survive the boot process, this is achieved using [[https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence][imperamanence]].
