## Intro
I track every half hour of my life to learn something about myself. I was ispired from some subbreddit like [r/dataisbeautiful]( https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/ ) and [r/quantifiedself]( https://www.reddit.com/r/QuantifiedSelf/ ).

## Tools
I use google spreadsheet to annotate all data, it's very simple and allow me to write from every device.
Then i use this page to visualize them.

## Data format
Data must be in csv and have these columns:
* ANNO
* MESE
* SETTIMANE
* GIORNI
* NOME_GIORNO
* ANNO_GIORNO

P.S. for now only italian language is support, so you must use it
